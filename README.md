# Enhanced-UISlider

The native UISlider can be a little difficult when you have a large range and not much space. Enhanced UI slider does two things.

1. Videos.app scrubber like behaivour. Pull down from the slider and the accuracy increases the further away you pull
2. Adds a pop over just above the slider drag control that shows the current value
